    <p>It is the year 2120 and the world has been thrown into absolute chaos. After careful consideration of these recent chain of events, scientists and news reporters have quite obviously determined that there has been an invasion on planet earth and the entire country is now officially on lockdown. In this time of great calamity, it may as well be the first breach of this immense scale ever to occur in national history, the president has been murdered by one of the undead disguised as the Russian ambassador. The US government is no longer functional, and all of mankind has turned to their own beliefs to govern themselves. In other words, the dead have arose from beyond the grave, and everyone is doomed to the grisly fate og death unless you can defend yourself. (This story is written from the point of view of a survivor of the disease X)</p>
    <h1>DAY 1</h1>
    <p>I've just woken up, an an idea occured to me- as in all survival drama's I have watched online thus far, The protagonists always document their survival. After seeing the news, I am convinvinced that I too, should be attempting to keep track of events in the case that humans survive and this becomes an event of the far past. I have been hiding at home these last 24 hours since the news reporter alerting the entire country had been eaten by a zombie, and I don't know how long the supplies in this house will last. I am extremely thankful however, that my family has vacationed to Europe over the summer, so I know at least that they will  be relatively safe as long as this epidemic does not spread overseas. I havent seen anyone coming out of their houses in my neighborhood either, I am not sure if I should start scavenging my area for weapons before the zombies begin to infest this part of New York. For now, I'll sleep through the day and wait until tomorrow to move with these distant howls and shrieks. The trees and the ground shake slightly, I can only imagine what is happening in Manhatttan. </p>
    <h1>DAY 2</h1>
    <p>The sun is shining, and I've decided to man up and go stockpile on food and suipplies. The local gun shop is two blocks down, so that was not a problem to break into. The supermarket is across the street, but there was a rabid dog in front of it so I had no choice but to put it down first. Or maybe it was the disease... Anyway, I am glad that I happened to think of the future before eveyone else, this way I have a sure chance for survival. My entire life, I had never imagined that I would find myself in this position now, attempting to find ways to escape from the undead, I did not even imagine such a thing to exist besides in movies. I am wondering now whether or not to find reliable people to assist me in fortressing the house, gathering even more supplies, as well as weapons. We have more of a chance by uniting to fight, but at the same time, I cannot afford to be betrayed. While the only person I can trust is myself currently, I might as well arm up and spread my offer. I must do so soon, fopr the zombies have already demoplished Manghattan as oper radio reports.
       </p>
    <h1>DAY 3</h1>
    <p>Today I knocked on my neighbors doors, creeping with a kind of corrosive paranoia gnawing at the back of my head. Only houses where men live though, women and children would be a burden. My town is where many of the most glorious military officers have hailed from, and luckily many do not marry for their honer depends on dying an honerable death. I have sucessfully collected 10 other people, they all promised to cooperate, but i will check for signs of Disease X later tonight while they are asleep. It will only be a few hours now, until the zombies begin their trek here, and we have completed a large wall, which we are still in the process of building currently. Tall blocks of cement, large trees, sandbags, anything sturdy we could find. We are working tirelessly and our hands are all raw, but that is trivial. Our wall will be 12 feet tsall, surrounding this beautiful mansion of pillars. Hopefully we will make it in time, I will return to help immediately. Until the next day, goodbye. </p>
    <h1>DAY 4</h1>
    <p>I have found today on the roof of my manor, a helicopter my father had been hiding, along with many other useful nmeans of transportation. We now have the power of flight, but we do not have enough gas to last us very long, which means we will have to risk our lives once more to go to the gas station. While we are in the next town, we will also raid the entire stores and homes, unfortunately that means killing everyone that gets in our way. But pleasently, I found a dog today, a giant german shepard named Lucky, he had been abandoned recently as he was rather thin, so I took him in. He will make an excellent guard dog and companion. The economy has crashed, politics are now in ruins, and society is being destrotyed. We held out for a while, and we have seen people limping and moaning on the streets, which is, I believe, the first symptom. Teaming with the pentagon or any sort of military base seems wise now. Though we fortressed our house, we do not know how long it will last against the attacks of hundreds of zombies. I have heard though, that my family has returned from europe because they were worried for me, in reading their emails and writing this journal, I believe the best course of action in this case would be to fly to the airport as soon as time will allow, and ensure their saftey. The others agreed to help since I offered them a safehaven. I will leave now. </p>
    <h1>DAY 5</h1>
    <p>Today, we will have a funeral for my parents, who have been devoured by zombies so thoroughly that nothing remained aboard the plane except for their belongings and splatters of blood. My parents, who have seen to it that I would grow up into a wonderful man. My parents, who were so full of compassion, murdered in the instant they had their brains ripped out of their skulls. What was once a quest for survival has become a fight for revenge, black and deadly, manifesting within me. I will at any cost experminate these vile vermin from my planet, and for this to happen, I must be better equipped. With our remaining gas, we have decided to fly to the Pentagon, and contribute our efforts to making the world pure once again.The strongest military base in the world, it should offer some means of containment. On that note, another bizzare event occured today as well, I stumbled upon a woman, who was dying of the side of the street. I thought nothing of it since it was now a very normal sight to see, but there were zombies advancing toward her. She sprang up and began to shoot at them with an enprmous machine gun screaming that her family deserved better. It struck me, and I slammed the brakes on my combat truck and yelled at her to get on. She had stared at me, and contnued to fight until I screamed that she would attract many others, and she finally ran on. She wouldn't talk to me, but she kept crying. I feel great sympathy for her, since I've gone through the same experience... my heart hurts for us both.     </p>
    <h1>DAY 6</h1>
    <p>She will accompanny us, which is another responsibility added to my rather long list of them, but she is a kind person, and her name is Charlotte. We are currently flying, and she has said nothing but her name so far. Hopefully, she will open up, becuase there is nothing more painful than to keep remembering moments of pain. I am at a loss, I do not know what to tell her at this point but to push on, the government will help us for sure. I keep reassuring everyone, but perhaps I'm only saying the phrase everythings going to be okay over and over agin to comfort myself. I see entire neighborhoods shrouded in ruin, and people lying dead on the streets. Hundreds, thousands, milllions of them. I do not feel pity for tem, rather curiosity, as to why they would ever venture out of their homes without the protection of anyone that has skill handling and using weapons. There are fires everywhere and the buildings are all demolished, how will New York ever rebuild itself if there are no people to pay taxes, live in the houses, or build them in the first place?  </p>
    <h1>DAY 100</h1>
    <p>This week, we bombed the White House, the Washington Monument, the Pentagon, the Empire State Building, World Trade Center (again), the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Verizano bridge, the Queensborough Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, the Battery Tunnel, and the entire boarder thousands of miles down deep in the earth. New York will float out into the Atlantic ocean, and will destroy itself from the inside. After we had arrived at the Pentagon exactly 100 days ago, we were all taken in under thier wing with great awe, and were immediately offered positions as temporary war officers in order to help with the containment of the threat. One of the ten men I had become extremely good friends with way walking through the labratory as he had gotten lost the first day we were here. He had overheard and relayed to all of us that had come together to my great shock that the Pentagon was testing some bio weapons, and accidentally had a breach, contaminating theier testing ground: New York. In the very end, the people every man, woman, and child trusted, were untrustworthy. These people deserve to die, we will travel the wolrd on a never ending adventure to find a cure.    </p>

      <p>When you drop something while a zombie is chasing you, run in a circle and pick up the thing that you dropped. 
      
      Don't be stupid and go into open areas. Go into small reserved areas that can only hold like 10 people at a time.

      Always travel with weapons that worklong range. Like a gun or a spear.
